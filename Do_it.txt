How to do ft_irc

First of all, it is a configuration project. 
The client does basically everything for you by forwarding some messages
that do a specific thing: the job is to get the server to do specific things
based on the cmd they get from the client 

The main classes to create are 

SERVER - duh
USER - one for every client, saves User ID, Nickname and password directly from client
    - needs to be able to be set to super User
    - needs to be able to be silent and limited to some things 
CHANNEL - creates a new sub-chat in the chat
